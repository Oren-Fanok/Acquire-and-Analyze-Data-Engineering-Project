The American people spoke."
484,POTUS,"Together, our Administration and Congressional Democrats have delivered results for working families – lowering prescription drug prices, bringing student debt relief to folks that need it, lowering health care premiums.

491,POTUS,Republicans in Congress’ number one priority is repealing the Inflation Reduction Act. It's the wrong thing to do in this moment. It'd cause everyday costs to go up – not down.
492,POTUS,"At the core of our democracy is a basic principle: the right to vote.
 
With it, anything is possible.
 
Vote today."
493,POTUS,"I'm focused on investing in America.

495,POTUS,"I inherited skyrocketing deficits partially caused by an unpaid-for $2 trillion tax cut that benefitted the very wealthy.

500,POTUS,"Do you know how much six of the largest oil companies have made over the last six months?

Over $100 billion.

That money should’ve been used to expand supply and lower prices at the pump."
501,POTUS,"Social Security and Medicare have been around for a long time.

Generations of Americans have counted on these programs. And you’ve earned them – with every single paycheck since your first job.

506,POTUS,"Congressional Republicans have embraced plans to cut Social Security and Medicare – like reducing benefits or increasing costs for retirees and raising the retirement age.
 
They’re not even hiding it."
507,POTUS,"I'll do what it takes to bring inflation down. 
 
But I won't accept the Republican argument that too many Americans have found good jobs and have more dignity in the workplace.  Or that our largest, most profitable corporations shouldn’t have to pay their fair share."
508,POTUS,"Ted Cruz said that folks who are receiving student debt relief are a bunch of “slackers.”
 
Who in God’s name do these guys think they are?"

516,POTUS,"Micron invested $100 billion to manufacture microchips in New York. Intel invested in Ohio. And global companies are investing billions to make things in America again.

These investments will lower the cost of buying a car, replacing a washing machine, or getting a new phone."
517,POTUS,"You don’t have to ask yourself: what is Congressional Republicans’ plan?
 
They’ve said it out loud.
 
They’ve proposed cutting the $2,000 cap on prescription drugs, the $35-a-month cap on insulin for seniors, tax credits for lower energy bills, and the 15% corporate minimum tax."
518,POTUS,"Republican leaders are saying that if I don't help them cut Social Security and Medicare then guess what?
 
They will wreak havoc on our economy and refuse to raise the debt ceiling. I'm not joking.
 
As my grandkids would say, “Google it.”"
519,POTUS,"I’m never going to apologize for helping working- and middle-class families as they recover from the economic crisis created by a pandemic.
 
I don’t want to hear it from Republican officials who sit in Congress and had pandemic relief loans forgiven."
520,POTUS,"America has now added jobs every single month of my Administration.
 
Every single month."
521,POTUS,"I’ve got a plan to bring costs down, especially for health care, energy, and other everyday expenses.

That's a real difference lowering monthly costs for families."
526,POTUS,"The folks at Viasat rely on microchips to build most everything they make.

Well, guess what: we're fighting them in the courts, and we’re not letting them get away with it."
531,POTUS,"If Republicans in Congress have their way, the power we just gave Medicare to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices goes away."
532,POTUS,Gas prices have declined by 24% over the past 20 weeks.
533,POTUS,"We’re capping seniors’ out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs at $2,000 a year.

I wish I could say our Republican friends in Congress helped make this happen. I truly do.

But the truth is, every single one of them voted against it. Every single one."
534,POTUS,"There are 16 million Americans who will have their student debt relief applications approved by the Department of Education by the end of this week.
 
They won’t be able to get their relief because Republican officials are standing in the way."
535,POTUS,"But look, I know families are squeezed by global inflation. It's why I have a plan to lower costs and build an economy from the bottom up and middle out.

The Republican plan is different. They want to increase health care and energy costs, while giving tax breaks to the wealthy."
536,POTUS,"Today's jobs report shows we've added 261,000 jobs and maintained a historically low unemployment rate of 3.7% – our economy is strong.

And, folks, despite Republican leadership rooting for recession, our economy continues to grow and add jobs as gas prices come down."
537,POTUS,"My Administration’s student debt relief plan is for the millions of working- and middle-class people trying to recover from the pandemic and pay for their education.
 
It's about giving people dignity. https://t.co/znhLfCBH2S"
538,POTUS,"The way I think about higher costs is the way my Dad talked about it and the way so many of you at home talk about it around the kitchen table.

Americans need more breathing room.

My Administration’s student debt relief plan is designed with that in mind."
539,POTUS,"Close to 26 million Americans have already given us the information to be considered for life-changing student debt relief.

They want to raise the retirement age, move towards privatization, and put these programs on the chopping block every five years."
543,POTUS,"Gas prices are back to levels they were at in early March.
 
We've responsibly released barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, announced plans to repurchase oil to get producers moving, and engaged with key oil companies and states to lower prices even more."
544,POTUS,"I know hidden junk fees – like processing fees on concert tickets – are a pain.

They’re unfair, deceptive, and add up.

That’s why, last week, I called on my Administration to crack down on these fees and put that money back in your pocket."
545,POTUS,"My top priority is lowering costs for American families.

That’s why I signed the Inflation Reduction Act – to lower prescription drug costs, lower health care costs, and lower energy costs.

But that relief is on hold – because Republican elected officials are doing everything they can to deny it, even to their own constituents."
549,POTUS,"Last month, I launched the application for our Administration’s student debt relief.

Close to 26 million Americans have already given us the information to be considered for this life-changing relief.

An economy that works for everyone."

562,POTUS,"Congressional Republicans want to cut Social Security and Medicare.
 
They’re even saying they’ll shut down the government and let America default on its debts if we won’t cooperate with the cuts.
 
Talk about irresponsible. https://t.co/w9F4FbjLoQ"
563,POTUS,"Some of you are on Social Security. Or your parents or grandparents are. 

They earned it with every single paycheck – from the day they started working.

Republicans in Congress want to put it on the chopping block."
564,POTUS,"Let’s be crystal clear on what repealing the Inflation Reduction Act means.

The power we gave Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices? Gone.

The $2,000 cap on prescription drugs for seniors? Gone.

The $35-a-month cap on insulin for folks on Medicare? Gone."
565,POTUS,"Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, if Big Pharma tries to raise drug prices faster than inflation, they’ll have to write a check to Medicare to cover the difference.

Instead of that money going to drug companies, it’ll go into your pockets in the form of lower drug prices."
566,POTUS,"You’ve been paying into Social Security your whole life. You earned it.

Now, Republicans in Congress want to cut it.

$100 billion in less than 200 days.

If these companies were taking average profits on refining, instead of the profits they’re making today, gas prices would come down around 50 cents."
573,POTUS,"Gas prices are down more than $1.20 since their peak this summer. And they’ve been falling for each of the last three weeks.

That’s adding up to real savings for America’s families."

Either invest in America by lowering prices for consumers at the pump and increasing production and refining capacity.

It’s failed for 50 years. It’ll fail again."
580,POTUS,"Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, we’re going to reduce the deficit by another $250 billion over the next decade.

Every single Republican in Congress voted against this reduction. And, they’re pushing for tax cuts that would drive the deficit up by $3 trillion."
581,POTUS,"We’re making sure the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share in taxes.

I signed into law a 15% corporate minimum tax. And, no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in federal taxes."
582,POTUS,"We’re capping seniors’ out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs at $2,000 a year – even if their drugs cost $10,000, $12,000, $14,000 a year like some cancer drugs do.

That’s real breathing room for folks who need it most."
585,POTUS,"Oil companies made billions in profits this quarter.

They’re using these record profits to pay out their wealthy shareholders instead of investing in production and lowering costs for Americans.

It’s unacceptable. It’s time for these companies to bring down prices at the pump."

Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, we’re capping that cost at $35 a month."

If Republicans in Congress have their way, these big corporations will go back to paying zero taxes in no time."
589,POTUS,"The deficit fell by $1.4 trillion this year. That’s the largest one-year drop in American history.

On the other hand, Congressional Republicans are pushing for tax cuts that would add about $3 trillion to the deficit."
