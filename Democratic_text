They won‚Äôt be able to get their relief because Republican officials are standing in the way."
535,POTUS,"But look, I know families are squeezed by global inflation. It's why I have a plan to lower costs and build an economy from the bottom up and middle out.

565,POTUS,"Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, if Big Pharma tries to raise drug prices faster than inflation, they‚Äôll have to write a check to Medicare to cover the difference.

Instead of that money going to drug companies, it‚Äôll go into your pockets in the form of lower drug prices."
566,POTUS,"You‚Äôve been paying into Social Security your whole life. You earned it.

Now, Republicans in Congress want to cut it.

Who the hell do they think they are?"

571,POTUS,Happy Halloween! https://t.co/zsNvQPDCs3
572,POTUS,"In the last six months, 6 of the largest oil companies made over $100 billion in profits.

$100 billion in less than 200 days.

If these companies were taking average profits on refining, instead of the profits they‚Äôre making today, gas prices would come down around 50 cents."
573,POTUS,"Gas prices are down more than $1.20 since their peak this summer. And they‚Äôve been falling for each of the last three weeks.

That‚Äôs adding up to real savings for America‚Äôs families."
574,POTUS,"The oil industry has a choice.

Either invest in America by lowering prices for consumers at the pump and increasing production and refining capacity.

Or pay a higher tax on your excessive profits and face other restrictions."

576,POTUS,"Jill and I send our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones during the bridge collapse in India, and join the people of Gujarat in mourning the loss of too many lives cut short. In this difficult hour, we will continue to stand with and support the Indian people."
577,POTUS,"I‚Äôm focused on creating good-paying jobs, lowering costs for families, and manufacturing more here at home.

Republicans in Congress have a different vision. One that benefits the wealthy and drives up and inflation and costs for everybody else."
578,POTUS,"I send my congratulations to Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva on his election to be the next president of Brazil following free, fair, and credible elections. I look forward to working together to continue the cooperation between our two countries in the months and years ahead."
579,POTUS,"For 50 years, the Congressional Republican economic policy has been simple. Take care of those at the top, and everything trickles down to the rest of us.

It‚Äôs failed for 50 years. It‚Äôll fail again."
580,POTUS,"Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, we‚Äôre going to reduce the deficit by another $250 billion over the next decade.

Every single Republican in Congress voted against this reduction. And, they‚Äôre pushing for tax cuts that would drive the deficit up by $3 trillion."
581,POTUS,"We‚Äôre making sure the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share in taxes.

I signed into law a 15% corporate minimum tax. And, no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in federal taxes."
582,POTUS,"We‚Äôre capping seniors‚Äô out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs at $2,000 a year ‚Äì even if their drugs cost $10,000, $12,000, $14,000 a year like some cancer drugs do.
 
Instead of that money going to Big Pharma, it‚Äôs going back into folks‚Äô pockets."
583,POTUS,"Jill and I are devastated to learn that at least two Americans are among so many who lost their lives in Seoul. Our hearts go out to their loved ones in this time of grief, and we continue to pray for the recovery of all who were injured."
584,POTUS,"We‚Äôre reducing the burden on working- and middle-class families by bringing down the costs of everyday things ‚Äì prescription drugs, health care premiums, and energy bills.
 
That‚Äôs real breathing room for folks who need it most."
585,POTUS,"Oil companies made billions in profits this quarter.

They‚Äôre using these record profits to pay out their wealthy shareholders instead of investing in production and lowering costs for Americans.

It‚Äôs unacceptable. It‚Äôs time for these companies to bring down prices at the pump."
586,POTUS,"Some seniors pay $400 a month for insulin. It‚Äôs ridiculous.

Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, we‚Äôre capping that cost at $35 a month."
587,POTUS,Jill and I send our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones in Seoul. We grieve with the people of the Republic of Korea and wish for a quick recovery to all those who were injured. The United States stands with the Republic of Korea during this tragic time.
588,POTUS,"Starting in January, companies making billions in profits will face a new requirement that they must pay taxes.

If Republicans in Congress have their way, these big corporations will go back to paying zero taxes in no time."
589,POTUS,"The deficit fell by $1.4 trillion this year. That‚Äôs the largest one-year drop in American history.

On the other hand, Congressional Republicans are pushing for tax cuts that would add about $3 trillion to the deficit."
590,POTUS,"I will never cut Medicare or Social Security. You have my word.
 
Republicans in Congress have made it clear they will hold the economy hostage if we don‚Äôt agree to their cuts to Medicare and Social Security. 

You should take them at their word."
591,POTUS,"Our economy has created 10 million jobs, unemployment is near a 50-year low, and U.S. manufacturing is booming.

That‚Äôs how you build an economy that works for everyone. https://t.co/OtjMCZE0ln"
592,POTUS,"Gas prices are down $1.25 since their peak this summer. That‚Äôs adding up to real savings for families.

We‚Äôre continuing to take action to decrease prices at the pump."
593,POTUS,"Let me give you the facts.

In 2020, 55 corporations made $40 billion. And they paid zero in federal taxes.

My Inflation Reduction Act puts an end to this."
594,POTUS,"We pay the highest price for prescription drugs of anywhere in the world.

My Inflation Reduction Act takes on Big Pharma to lower prescription drug costs for families and seniors.

Congressional Republicans have said their #1 priority is to repeal it."
595,POTUS,"Under my predecessor, the country lost over 180,000 manufacturing jobs.

On my watch, we‚Äôve created 700,000 manufacturing jobs ‚Äì adding manufacturing jobs at the fastest rate in nearly 40 years. https://t.co/0DsmZHY430"
596,POTUS,"It‚Äôs simple.

I‚Äôm focused on growing our economy from the bottom up and the middle out.

Congressional Republicans are focused on implementing a trickle-down plan that will benefit the wealthy and raise costs for middle class and working folks."

It‚Äôs a reality. https://t.co/JZESB7Fz4B"

Yet Congressional Republicans love to call Democratic leaders ‚Äúbig spenders.‚Äù Give me a break."
599,POTUS,"Folks, hidden ""junk"" fees are unfair. And they hit the most vulnerable Americans hardest, especially low-income folks and people of color.
