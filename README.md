# Text-Mining-Acquire-and-Analyze-Project

# Overview

This project was designed to access and store tweets from a variety of Twitter users and Twitter hashtags spanning conservative and liberal viewpoints in the United States. The acquisition of tweets and user information is done using elevated Twitter API access.

For this model, tweets are pulled from three handles and one hashtag for each of the two parties. Once tweets are pulled they are stored in data frames according to political leaning. The pulled tweets are then cleaned and prepared for analysis. 

# Analysis 1: Most Popular Words and Organizations by Party

The first analysis determines the most popular words and groups by political party. These cells produce a bar chart visualization of the most popular words and another bar chart for the most popular organizations.

# Analysis 2: Text Patterns by Party

The second analysis performed is an analysis of text patterns in each group of text (see my text patterns repository for specifics).

# Analysis 3: Spacy SVO Parsing by Party

In the third analysis, each group is run through a parsing analysis that outputs the 20 most common subject-verb-object (SVO) trios.

# Analysis 4: Text Comparison between Parties

The text comparison analysis finds words disproportionately represented in each group when compared to the other political party's tweets. Please refer to my text comparison repo for more background.
